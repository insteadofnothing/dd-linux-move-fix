# dd-linux-move-fix
A mod which fixes the slow movement bug for Dungeondraft on Linux.

Enabling this mod should restore the normal movement behavior for the select tool. It can be toggled on and off using a new button at the top of the select tool panel.

## WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN PERIL!

The current Dungeondraft API is very unstable, and the mod may have bugs. I've done my best to test it, but I can't ensure a crash is impossible. *Save early and often.*

## Known Issues

* This mod causes exception spam in the console. Harmless, but disable it if you need to read the logs.
* Undoing a prop while moving it can put the editor in a bad state. Right clicking and then left clicking usually resolves this.
